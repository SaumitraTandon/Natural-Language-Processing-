## Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a crucial field in machine learning that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. In this project, we build an NLP model to classify restaurant reviews into positive or negative sentiments. This involves preprocessing the text data, creating a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using techniques like Bag of Words.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of machine learning models to classify text data.
- **Evaluation**: Performance evaluation of the model using metrics like accuracy.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of restaurant reviews, `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`, which contains user-generated reviews. The dataset is in TSV (Tab Separated Values) format, with each review labeled as positive or negative.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-project.git
   cd nlp-project
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook `natural_language_processing.ipynb` and execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Understanding the Code**:
   - **Library Imports**: The necessary libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`) are imported for data manipulation and visualization.
   - **Dataset Loading**: Load the dataset using `pandas`:
     ```python
     dataset = pd.read_csv('Restaurant_Reviews.tsv', delimiter='\t', quoting=3)
     ```
   - **Text Preprocessing**: Includes steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming to prepare the text data for modeling.
   - **Model Implementation**: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data to classify the reviews.
   - **Results Visualization**: Visualize the results and performance metrics using `matplotlib`.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, and the results are visualized to show how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative reviews.
